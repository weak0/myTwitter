# my Twitter
This is my first independent major project.
I used HTML / CSS / VANILA JS

The most important features:

Trends For You - recommend categories based on activity (likes and comments),
Who to follow - recommend people based on the category of posts you like,
New post - you can add a post that will be added to the wall and your profile, you can add a photo, give a like like all other posts,
Emoji Picker - it's my own emoji selector, it's easy to set up and use in other projects,
Sort wall - (right corner of the main wall icon) sorts posts by activity or date,
Follow - you can follow the person you recommend, and the person's post will be added to your board,
Settings - you can change your profile settings (nickname / profile img).

What have i learned:

Work with input type = file,
sort () function,
Date () object,
I improve my skills with Obiect-oriented programming,

What needs to be corrected (imo):

I need to write clearer code, start using SASS, systematize selectors eg with conevension like BEM
